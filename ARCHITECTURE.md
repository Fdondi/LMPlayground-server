# Architecture

LM Playground runs GGUF models on-device through [llama.cpp](https://github.com/andriydruk/llama.cpp-android)
(a fork carrying one patch — see [fd:N paths](#fdn-file-descriptor-paths)).
This document maps the moving parts and the contracts between them.

## Process model

The app runs in two processes:

- **Main process** — UI (Compose + Fragments), Room persistence, downloads,
  storage. Everything the user touches.
- **`:llama` process** (release builds) — hosts `LlamaService`, the AIDL
  service that owns all native llama.cpp state. If native code crashes
  (bad GGUF, GPU driver bug, OOM), only this process dies; the app stays
  up, marks the in-flight message as interrupted, and offers a reload.
  Debug builds run the service in-process for easier debugging.

`App.onCreate` checks `ProcessUtils.isLlamaProcess()` and skips Room and
repository initialization in the `:llama` process.

## Public inference API

Other apps can run inference through LM Playground by binding
`ApiService` (action `com.druk.lmplayground.api.BIND_CHAT_SERVICE`), the
only exported component besides `MainActivity`. Payloads are
OpenAI-shaped JSON strings, so a client migrating off a remote
OpenAI-compatible server changes its transport and keeps its data model.
Contract and schemas: `playground-api/PROTOCOL.md`.

```

  ├── IChatService.aidl / IChatCompletionCallback.aidl
  ├── json/RequestCodec, ResponseCodec, ErrorCodec   one schema definition
  └── LmPlaygroundClient  client SDK: discovery, bind, Flow<ChatEvent>

  ├── ApiService           thin Stub; per-transaction ApiAccessPolicy check
  ├── ChatCompletionHandler transport-agnostic core → ResponseSink
  ├── BinderResponseSink   coalesces chunks; linkToDeath on the client
  ├── EngineArbiter        engineMutex, foreground publication, crash collector
  ├── HeadlessModelManager transient model owner (EmbeddingModelManager shape)
  ├── ApiModelResolver     pure capability matching / auto-selection
  ├── ApiTurnRunner        one turn on a per-request session
  ├── ApiHistoryMapper     OpenAI messages[] → replay pairs + final turn
  ├── StreamDeltaTracker   accumulated string → monotonic deltas
  ├── ParkedToolTurns      continuation tokens for client-side tool calls
  └── BlobStore            putBlob / data: URL images
```

**The user's chat is never disturbed.** An API request creates its *own*
`LlamaGenerationSession` on the model already loaded, so the chat's KV
cache is untouched — `LlamaService` claims its `GenerationWorker` slot per
**session**, and two `llama_context`s over one read-only `llama_model` is
a supported llama.cpp pattern. If a model is loaded that does not meet the
request's `lmp.require`, the request is **refused**, never served by
evicting the user's model. With nothing loaded, `HeadlessModelManager`
loads the smallest qualifying model and unloads it after 5 minutes idle.

`ModelRuntime` publishes every model transition to the arbiter through
`ModelRuntime.SharedModelSink` (null in tests). Publication happens
*after* history replay succeeds, and is cleared *before* any blocking
teardown, so the arbiter never sees a half-built or doomed handle.

**Concurrency.** `EngineArbiter.engineMutex` serialises API turns against
each other; a queued request waits 15 s then gets `engine_busy`. The user
never waits on it — an API request yields to an in-flight chat turn for
20 s and then proceeds anyway. Blocking Send behind a background app
would be worse than two slow generations.

**Crash handling is mandatory, not defensive.**
`LlamaGenerationSession.generateAll` awaits a `CompletableDeferred` with
no timeout, so if `:llama` dies the callback never arrives and an API
request would hang forever. The arbiter collects `InferenceClient.state`
and, on `Crashed`, emits `engine_unavailable` immediately and cancels
**without joining** (the cancellation path's `NonCancellable` 30 s drain
is waiting on a worker that will never answer).

**Access control is in code, not the manifest.** A custom `<permission>`
is only granted to clients installed *after* LM Playground, so a client
installed first would silently never receive it. `ApiAccessPolicy` is
checked per transaction via `Binder.getCallingUid()` (read synchronously
on the binder thread — it is thread-local to the transaction). Shipped
policy is `UserToggleAccessPolicy` over Settings → Advanced → "Allow
other apps", default ON; allowlist, signature pinning, bearer token and
interactive consent all fit the same `check()` signature.

**The AIDL interface is append-only.** Binder transaction codes are
positional and third-party clients are not rebuilt when we update;
`ApiTransactionOrderTest` fails CI on a reorder.

## Document Q&A (RAG)

Attaching a document to a chat runs extract → chunk → embed → store, then
every user turn in that chat retrieves the most relevant chunks and
prepends them to the *wire copy* of the message (UI and Room keep the
original; history replay resends originals since retrieval re-runs per
turn — see `ConversationViewModel.buildWireContent`).

- `com.druk.lmplayground.rag` — `DocumentTextExtractors` (PDF via
  pdfbox-android, DOCX via ZIP+XmlPullParser, EPUB/HTML via jsoup, plain
  text), `TextChunker` (paragraph/sentence-aware, ~1000 chars + overlap),
  `RagRepository` (indexing job on an application-scoped coroutine so it
  survives navigation; cosine top-K in Kotlin over the session's vectors),
  `EmbeddingModelManager` (EmbeddingGemma task prefixes).
- Vectors live in Room (`rag_documents`, `rag_chunks`; embeddings are
  L2-normalized float32 BLOBs) keyed by session — brute-force dot product
  is milliseconds at on-device scale, so no vector index. The original
  file is never copied; `rag_documents.sourceUri` plus a persisted SAF
  read grant lets the chat's document chip reopen it (graceful toast when
  the file or grant is gone).
- The embedding model (EmbeddingGemma 300M, downloaded on demand like any
  catalog model but hidden from the chat picker) loads through the normal
  `loadModel` path; `createEmbeddingSession` makes a separate
  embeddings-enabled context (mean pooling) in `LlamaService`, independent
  of generation sessions. It stays warm for 60 s after the last embed
  call, then unloads (`EmbeddingModelManager`) so ~300 MB doesn't sit
  next to a multi-GB chat model.

## Threading contracts

- **`InferenceClient.requireConnected()` must not run on the main
  thread** — it can block up to 10 s racing the service bind. Debug
  builds enforce this with a `check()`. Coroutine callers use
  `awaitConnected()` instead.
- Generation runs on a dedicated thread in the service
  (`GenerationWorker`); streamed tokens arrive on binder threads. All
  `ModelRuntime.Listener` / `GenerationCoordinator.Listener` callbacks may
  fire from background dispatchers — the ViewModel only uses `postValue`
  and `Snapshot.withMutableSnapshot` there.
- `ModelRuntime` mutators are called from the main dispatcher; they
  capture-and-null handles on the caller's thread before hopping to
  `Dispatchers.Default` for blocking native work.
- `setImageData` and `addMessage` are separate AIDL transactions on
  different binder threads; the staged image bytes are guarded by a mutex
  in the native session.

## fd:N file descriptor paths

Models live in a user-chosen SAF folder, which has no filesystem path.
The app opens a `ParcelFileDescriptor` and sends it over AIDL; the
service dups it and builds an `fd:N` pseudo-path that the fork's
`ggml_fopen` / `llama-mmap` understand. This is the only patch carried
on the llama.cpp fork. The app-side PFD is kept alive in `ModelRuntime`
for the model's lifetime (the mmap dies with the descriptor).

## AIDL payload budget

Binder transactions cap at ~1 MB. `InferenceLimits.MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`
gates every string crossing the boundary (messages, system prompts,
replayed history) — see `HistoryReplay.validateReplaySize` and the
pre-flight checks in the ViewModel. Session replay is chunked.

## Vulkan policy

The LLM always decodes on CPU (KleidiAI kernels on arm64). Vulkan is
reserved for the CLIP vision encoder, with two safety nets in
`native-lib.cpp`: a static GPU denylist, and a crash-sentinel file
written around the risky init — if it survives a process restart, Vulkan
vision is permanently disabled for that install and CLIP runs on CPU.

## Crash visibility

The release AAB packages native debug symbols
(`ndk.debugSymbolLevel = SYMBOL_TABLE` in `app/build.gradle.kts`), so
Google Play Console symbolicates `:llama` native crashes. This is
deliberate: no crash-reporting SDK, matching the app's fully-offline,
privacy-first positioning. Kotlin crashes deobfuscate via the R8 mapping
file that the AAB already carries.

## Test infrastructure

- **Unit tests** (`app/src/test`, JVM + Robolectric): pure logic
  (models, tools, history replay, tool-call mapping), Room-backed stores
  (in-memory DB), WorkManager enqueue policy (`WorkManagerTestInitHelper`).
  CI runs them with `-PskipScreenshots` — Paparazzi goldens are not
  git-tracked.
- **Paparazzi screenshots** (`app/src/test/.../screenshots`): Play Store
  screenshots, 28 locales; `recordPaparazziDebug` auto-organizes them
  into `fastlane/`.
- **Instrumented tests** (`app/src/androidTest`): real model loads and
  generation (`ModelGenerationTest` — needs GGUFs in `/data/local/tmp`),
  service/proxy lifecycle, ViewModel tool-call turns, and the exported
  API surface (`ApiServiceTest` — real binder transactions, no GGUF
  needed). CI runs `app:mvdApi35Check` on a managed emulator.
- **API module + sample**: `playground-api:lintDebug` and
  `samples:chat-client:lintDebug` run separately in CI, because
  `app:lintDebug` does not analyze dependencies
  (`lint.checkDependencies` defaults to false). CI also builds
  `samples:chat-client`, which depends *only* on `:playground-api` — that
  build breaking is the signal that something leaked out of the public
  contract.
- Warning: `connectedAndroidTest` wipes the app's SAF folder grant on a
  real device; re-pick the folder before manual testing (`installDebug`).
